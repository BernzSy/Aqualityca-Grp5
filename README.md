# Aqualityca
Aqualityca establishes its focus on delivering water quality assessment methods that combine viable access while maintaining both precision and operating efficiency for water refilling services. This AI-based web application performs water potability assessments using user-generated test strip results for pH and chlorine concentration together with turbidity and hardness measurements and total dissolved solids (TDS) analysis. Through its manual data entry system combined with an intelligence algorithm, the solution eliminates the requirement of cumbersome systems and complex machinery. This system delivers comprehensive water analysis which either identifies water as "potable" or "non-potable" while providing information about parameters that deviate from recommended ranges. The system produces fundamental statistical reports that present parameters of water quality average values median values and most frequent readouts throughout specified time ranges. These features of this project are designed to assist businesses in maintaining compliance with health and safety standards, improving decision-making, and ensuring the consistent delivery of safe drinking water.
